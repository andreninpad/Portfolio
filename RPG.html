/*JavaScript interacts with the HTML using the Document Object Model, or DOM. The DOM is a tree of objects that represents the HTML. HTML can be accessed using the document object, which represents the entire HTML document.
One method for finding specific elements in the HTML is using the querySelector() method. The querySelector() method takes a CSS selector as an argument and returns the first element that matches that selector. For example, to find the <h1> element in the HTML, write as the example code:
let h1 = document.querySelector("h1");
Note that h1 is a string and matches the CSS selector you would use.*/

  /*Objects are non primitive data types that store key-value pairs. Non primitive data types are mutable data types that are not undefined, null, boolean, number, string, or symbol. Mutable means that the data can be changed after it is created. Objects are similar to arrays, except that instead of using indexes to access and modify their data, access the data in objects through properties. Properties consist of a key and a value. The key is the name of the property, and the value is the data stored in the property. If the property name (key) of an object has a space in it, use single or double quotes around the name.
  Here is the basic syntax for an object:
  {
    key: value,
    "Space Name": "Kirk"
  };
  There are two ways to access the properties of an object: dot notation (.) and bracket notation ([]), similar to an array. Example Code: object.property;
  Here is a sample of using dot notation (.) to read the name property of the developer object:
  Example Code:
  const developer = {
    name: "Jessica",
  };
  //Output: Jessica
  console.log(developer.name);
  The second way to access the properties of an object is bracket notation ([]). If the property of the object you are trying to access has a space in its name, you will need to use bracket notation. Example Code: objectName["property name"];
  Here is a sample of using bracket notation to read an object's property: Example Code:
  const spaceObj = {
    "Space Name": "Kirk",
  };
  spaceObj["Space Name"]; //"Kirk"
